    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 20px;">The rules are straightforward:</p>
    <ol style="color: #666; font-size: 18px;">
        <li>Rock beats Scissors: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rock crushes or blunts scissors.</span></li>
        <li>Scissors beats Paper: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scissors cuts paper.</span></li>
        <li>Paper beats Rock: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper covers rock.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color: #666; font-size: 18px;">These rules form a cyclic relationship where each option beats one and loses to another, creating a balanced game. When both players choose the same option, it results in a tie. The game is often played as a hand game between two people but can also be simulated with computer opponents or integrated into various games and applications.</p>
